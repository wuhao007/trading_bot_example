Assume you have 1000 USDC and 1000 USD. Bot places two sell orders:
- sell 500 USDC @1.0002
- sell 500 USDC @1.0008

and three buy orders
- buy 200 USDC @ .998
- buy 300 USDC @ .996
- buy 500 USDC @ .992

Bot distributes buy and sell orders depending on the parameters in config file: 
percentage of balance and price level.

config.py - set up tradable pairs, buy/sell levels and path to API keys and logs

main.py - gets data from Kraken API and pass it to trade function

include2.py - analyses API data and submits trading requests

include.py - this is a collection of helper functions

other/k0.key - put your API key here
